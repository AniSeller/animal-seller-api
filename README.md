# Animal seller api

This is backend for a brand new service of selling the animals 
It contains authentification logic (self-written, by the way ðŸ˜œ) 
and post handling 

It's written on ASP .NET Core MVC and may not be the best implementation of the
needed functionality, it's the first such project of mine
